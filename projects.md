## Gravel Bed Rivers
Archived aerial images act as an extensive historical record, which can be used to extract information about past landscapes. Within the lower Fraser River, ongoing efforts to compute accurate sediment budget calculations have established a need for areal estimates of surficial sand and gravel that correspond to hydrographic surveys conducted in 1952, 1984, 1999, and 2008. The analog aerial images captured during these survey dates record the reflectance characteristics of sand and gravel differently than contemporary digital aerial images. These differences were simulated in digital images captured in April 2018 and paired with ground truthed reference data to develop a classification that can be used to delineate patches of sand and gravel in analog aerial images of the lower Fraser River.

## Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
This is ongoing research that seeks to examine the relationship between various spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic variables and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in British Columbia. I was primarily involved in the preparation of independent (i.e., explanatory) variables, which included data acquisition and mining, dimensionality reduction, and areal interpolation to upscale, downscale, and impute data into consistent spatial aggregation units (i.e., enumeration zone).
 
Additionally, as part of this research, I developed a classification which delineates suburban areas as well as the built up land cover classes identified by the Global Human Settlement project such as urban centers, urban clusters, towns, rural areas, and areas without an established human presence.

## Deaths of Environmental Activists
Environmental defenders are individuals who risk their lives to protect the environment. We are using generalized linear models to to conduct a cross-national analysis of the deaths that are associated with this activism. Spatial maximum entropy models are also being used to understand the spatial dynamics of these deaths in countries with a particularly high number of deaths per capita.

## Field Work Application
While at Carthage College, I developed mobile application for departments within the natural sciences, so that data  gathered during labs and field research could be systematically collected and accumulated on a inter-departmental server.

## Buckthorn
While working as an intern at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, I used a supervised classification to identify suspected buckthorn infestations in Minnesota's State Forests. The locations of these suspected buckthorn infestations were verified during a summer-long field campaign. As part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed a habitat suitability model using crowd sourced data acquired from EDDmapS to further increase the accuracy with which buckthorn is detected in Minnesota and understand patterns of spread. 

## Habitat Suitability
The ñandu (Rhea pennata pennata), also known as Darwin’s Rhea, is a large flightless land bird. It is native to Patagonia, but in recent years, all but two populations have been extirpated from Chile. As part of a team, I conducted the field work necessary to develop a habitat suitability model for a small remaining population of ñandu located in southern Chilean Patagonia near the Argentine border. We collected data on several variables including live ñandu sightings, vegetation cover (height, percentage, and type), and sign (tracks or scat) of ñandu and their predators (culpeo fox, domestic dog, and puma). We also surveyed fences in the area for ñandu scat density, in order to understand the effect of fences on ñandu behavior.
