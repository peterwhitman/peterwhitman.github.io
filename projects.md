# Cyanobacterial Blooms

# Gravel Bed Rivers

Archived aerial images act as an extensive historical record, which can be used to extract information about past landscapes. Within the lower Fraser River, ongoing efforts to compute accurate sediment budget calculations have established a need for areal estimates of surficial sand and gravel that correspond to hydrographic surveys conducted in 1952, 1984, 1999, and 2008. The analog aerial images captured during these survey dates record the reflectance characteristics of sand and gravel differently than contemporary digital aerial images. These differences were simulated in digital images captured in April 2018 and paired with ground truthed reference data to develop a classification that can be used to delineate patches of sand and gravel in analog aerial images of the lower Fraser River.

# Carthage College Field Work Mobile Application

While at Carthage College, I developed mobile application for departments within the natural sciences, so that data  gathered during labs and field research could be systematically collected and accumulated on a inter-departmental server.

# Buckthorn

While working as an intern at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, I used a supervised classification to identify suspected buckthorn infestations in Minnesota's State Forests. The locations of these suspected buckthorn infestations were verified during a summer-long field campaign. As part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed a habitat suitability model using crowd sourced data acquired from EDDmapS to further increase the accuracy with which buckthorn is detected in Minnesota and understand patterns of spread. 

# Habitat Suitability Analysis 

The ñandu (Rhea pennata pennata), also known as Darwin’s Rhea, is a large flightless land bird. It is native to Patagonia, but in recent years, all but two populations have been extirpated from Chile. As part of a team, I conducted the field work necessary to develop a habitat suitability model for a small remaining population of ñandu located in southern Chilean Patagonia near the Argentine border. We collected data on several variables including live ñandu sightings, vegetation cover (height, percentage, and type), and sign (tracks or scat) of ñandu and their predators (culpeo fox, domestic dog, and puma). We also surveyed fences in the area for ñandu scat density, in order to understand the effect of fences on ñandu behavior.
