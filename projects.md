## Oil
I am primarily involved with the Cyanobacteria Assessment Network, or CyAN, which is an interagency research effort between the U.S. EPA, USGS, NASA, and NOAA. The objective of CyAN is to develop an early warning indicator system using historical and current satellite data to detect algal blooms in U.S. freshwater systems. This research supports federal, state, and local partners in their monitoring efforts to assess water quality to protect aquatic and human health.

The primary data sources for this project are two European Space Agency satellites. The first was used to collect data over the United States from 2008 through 2011. This sensor was called the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and was onboard the Envisat satellite. Beginning in 2017, data were obtained from the Ocean and Land Colour Imager (OLCI) onboard the Sentinel-3 series. A spectral shape algorithm is used to estimate cyanobacterial abundance based on absorption centered at 681 nm. Each sensor has a spatial resolution of 300 m which allows for just over 2,000 large waterbodies across the continental United States to be resolved given that each waterbody must be of sufficient size and shape to accomodate the spatial resolution of the sensor. 

My contributions to the CyAN project include analyzing the frequency of cyanobacterial blooms, quantifying their impacts on drinking water intakes, and assessing the regional timing of peak cyanobacterial blooms.

## Remote Sensing of Seagrass 
In collaboration with Old Dominion University, we use commercial satellite imagery to map seagrass extent in coastal ecosystems in the Eastern United States, particularly the Florida coast, the Chesapeake Bay, and the coast of New England. As this project continues, we plan to use these maps of seagrass extent to estimate carbon sequestration in these ecosystems. This analysis will help reduce our uncertainty in estimates of carbon storage in seagrass beds worldwide. 

This project uses data from two commercial satellites, Worldview-2 and Worldview-3. These satellites have a 2 m spatial resolution allowing for our analyses to capture the high spatial variability of seagrass beds which are often intermixed with sand, coral, and other aquatic ecosystems. Surface reflectance along the red edge of the electromagnetic spectrum can be used to classify regions containing seagrass. Once extent has been confidently mapped, we can use this information along with a carbon sequestration model to estimate the amount of carbon stored in seagrass in this regions. 

## Gravel Bed Rivers
Archived aerial images act as an extensive historical record, which can be used to extract information about past landscapes. Within the lower Fraser River, ongoing efforts to compute accurate sediment budget calculations have established a need for areal estimates of surficial sand and gravel that correspond to hydrographic surveys conducted in 1952, 1984, 1999, and 2008. The analog aerial images captured during these survey dates record the reflectance characteristics of sand and gravel differently than contemporary digital aerial images. These differences were simulated in digital images captured in April 2018 and paired with ground truthed reference data to develop a classification that can be used to delineate patches of sand and gravel in analog aerial images of the lower Fraser River.

## Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest
This is ongoing research that seeks to examine the relationship between various spatial, temporal, and socioeconomic variables and the outcomes of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest events in British Columbia. I was primarily involved in the preparation of independent (i.e., explanatory) variables, which included data acquisition and mining, dimensionality reduction, and areal interpolation to upscale, downscale, and impute data into consistent spatial aggregation units (i.e., enumeration zone).
 
Additionally, as part of this research, I developed a classification which delineates suburban areas as well as the built up land cover classes identified by the Global Human Settlement project such as urban centers, urban clusters, towns, rural areas, and areas without an established human presence.

## Deaths of Environmental Activists
Environmental defenders are individuals who risk their lives to protect the environment. We are using generalized linear models to to conduct a cross-national analysis of the deaths that are associated with this activism. Spatial maximum entropy models are also being used to understand the spatial dynamics of these deaths in countries with a particularly high number of deaths per capita.

## Field Work Application
While at Carthage College, I developed mobile application for departments within the natural sciences, so that data  gathered during labs and field research could be systematically collected and accumulated on a inter-departmental server.

## Buckthorn
While working as an intern at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, I used a supervised classification to identify suspected buckthorn infestations in Minnesota's State Forests. The locations of these suspected buckthorn infestations were verified during a summer-long field campaign. As part of my undergraduate thesis, I developed a habitat suitability model using crowd sourced data acquired from EDDmapS to further increase the accuracy with which buckthorn is detected in Minnesota and understand patterns of spread. 

## Habitat Suitability
The ñandu (Rhea pennata pennata), also known as Darwin’s Rhea, is a large flightless land bird. It is native to Patagonia, but in recent years, all but two populations have been extirpated from Chile. As part of a team, I conducted the field work necessary to develop a habitat suitability model for a small remaining population of ñandu located in southern Chilean Patagonia near the Argentine border. We collected data on several variables including live ñandu sightings, vegetation cover (height, percentage, and type), and sign (tracks or scat) of ñandu and their predators (culpeo fox, domestic dog, and puma). We also surveyed fences in the area for ñandu scat density, in order to understand the effect of fences on ñandu behavior.
